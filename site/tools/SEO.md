# Search engines and prismdl.site

How the site is set up for search, and what to run when it changes. `site/tools/` is not
published (pages.yml deletes it before deploying).

## What is on the site

- `index.html` plus landing pages built by `build-pages.py` from `tools/pages/*.html`:
  `/windows/`, `/mac/`, `/linux/`, `/browser-extension/`, `/idm-alternative/`, `/hugging-face/`,
  and `404.html` (noindex). The pages target real queries from Google's autocomplete
  (download manager for pc, download manager chrome extension, idm alternative for mac,
  hugging face download slow, download gguf from huggingface, ...).
- JSON-LD: `WebSite`, `Person`, `SoftwareApplication`, `SoftwareSourceCode` on the home page
  (the landing pages copy them), `WebPage` + `BreadcrumbList` on each landing page, and
  `FAQPage` written from each page's visible FAQ. Google stopped showing FAQ rich results in
  2026, but the markup is still valid and other engines and AI search read it. `VideoObject`
  for the film on the home page.
- `sitemap.xml` (written by `build-pages.py`, `<lastmod>` only moves when a page changes),
  `robots.txt` pointing at it, the IndexNow key `<32 hex>.txt`, and `llms.txt` (a plain summary
  some AI tools read; Google ignores it).
- Download links in page sources use `{{version}}`, so `build-pages.py` keeps them on the release
  that `index.html` links to.

## When something changes

1. Edit `site/index.html` or `site/tools/pages/<page>.html` (never the generated
   `site/<page>/index.html` or the FAQ JSON-LD between the `faq-jsonld` markers).
2. `python site/tools/build-pages.py`
3. After a release, the "Site: x.y.z links" step also bumps `softwareVersion`, `dateModified`
   and `releaseNotes` in the home page JSON-LD; then run `build-pages.py` so the landing pages
   get the new download links.
4. After the site is live: `python site/tools/indexnow.py` (Bing, Yandex, Seznam…), and in
   Google Search Console, *URL inspection → Request indexing* for pages that matter.

## Verifying ownership

Google Search Console (https://search.google.com/search-console), signed in with the owner's
Google account:

- **Domain property (recommended):** enter `prismdl.site`, copy the `google-site-verification=…`
  TXT record into the domain's DNS at the registrar, wait until it resolves, click *Verify*.
  Covers http/https and every subdomain. Nothing changes in this repository.
- **URL-prefix property** `https://prismdl.site/`, if DNS isn't at hand: either the *HTML tag*
  method (put the `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="…">` tag where the comment
  in `index.html`'s `<head>` says) or the *HTML file* method (put `google<token>.html` into
  `site/`). Keep the tag or file for good: removing it un-verifies the site.

Then: *Sitemaps* → add `sitemap.xml`.

Bing Webmaster Tools (https://www.bing.com/webmasters): *Import from Google Search Console*
once Google is verified (no extra tag needed), or add the site with the `msvalidate.01` meta
tag / `BingSiteAuth.xml` file. Submit `https://prismdl.site/sitemap.xml`.
